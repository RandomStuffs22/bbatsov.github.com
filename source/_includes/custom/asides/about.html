  <h1>About Bozhidar</h1>
  <p>My name is Bozhidar Batsov and I'm a professional software engineer
  from Sofia, Bulgaria. I'm quite fond of Unix, programming and
  Emacs. From time to time I teach programming courses and speak at
  tech conferences. I also happen to blog here (albeit rarely) about
  various stuff mostly related to programming.</p>
