Hello, everyone! Welcome to my blog! 

I’ll post here bits and pieces inspired by my humble experience as a
software developer. Expect to see here primarily stuff about Java and
Ruby, but also about software development in general. 

As a fan of the Star Wars franchise I often like to quote characters
from the movies. I feel that this is the time for one such quote –
“Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an
apprentice.”. I’m no dev wizard by any means, but I hope that I can
help someone learn something helpful and maybe I’ll learn something
from the readers of my blog(if I have any that is:)). In this sense
one can say that in life we’re always the master and the apprentice at
the same time… 

I hope you’ll enjoy reading my blog!
