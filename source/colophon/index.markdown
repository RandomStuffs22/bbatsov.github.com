It's probably no surprise (after all it says so in the footer) that
this site is generated with [Octopress](http://octopress.org) - a
blogging framework for hackers, built on top of the venerable Jekyll
blog-aware static site generator.

I write all of the articles in Emacs 24 and publish them via git to
GitHub pages. Everything is running on MacOS X Lion. The keyboard I'm
using is [Das Keyboard Ultimate](http://daskeyboard.com).

I'm using Octopress's default theme with no changes whatsoever to
it. The code snippets are highlighted with the dark version of the
popular [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).

The source code of the site is freely available at [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov/bbatsov.github.com).
