It's probably no surprise (but at least it's not immediately apparent) that
this site is generated with [Octopress](http://octopress.org) - a
blogging framework for hackers, built on top of the venerable [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
blog-aware static site generator.

I write all of the articles in [Emacs 24.2](http://emacsformacosx.com/) and publish them via git to
GitHub pages. Everything is running on MacOS X Mountain Lion. The keyboard I'm
using is [Das Keyboard Ultimate](http://daskeyboard.com).

I'm using [Octopress Slash theme](http://zespia.tw/Octopress-Theme-Slash/) with no changes whatsoever to
it. The code snippets are highlighted with the light version of the
popular [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).

The source code of the site is freely available at [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov/bbatsov.github.com).
