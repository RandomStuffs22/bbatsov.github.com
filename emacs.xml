    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> 0.10.0 is out!</p>

<p>This might come as a surprise for people tracking Projectile&rsquo;s
development, since recent snapshots were using 1.0 as the version
number, so allow me to explain. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to release
Projectile 1.0 for a while now, but I felt that without the addition
of <em>per-project settings</em> support and some refinements to the way
<em>ignoring of files &amp; folders</em> currently work, such moniker would be
unjustified. Unfortunately, lately I&rsquo;ve been quite busy working on
other projects like <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">cider</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> and I don&rsquo;t have
that much time to work on Projectile, so I kept delaying the 1.0
version.</p>

<p>Recently I decided to release version 0.10 instead, for the benefit of
users of package repos like Marmalade. The minor bump in the version
doesn&rsquo;t mean that 0.10 is not a noteworthy update, though. 5 months of
development and more than a hundred commits from almost a dozen of
developers have really improved the Projectile experience.  It&rsquo;s
easily the biggest update of Projectile, since the project was
conceived.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.projectile</code> is always taken into account (previously it was consulted only when doing <code>native</code> indexing)</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s now the ability to search for files in a specific directory</li>
<li>More project types are recognized</li>
<li>You can search for etags (ctags) in a project</li>
<li><strong>The Commander</strong> (a really cool feature inspired from CIDER &amp; SLIME, that I&rsquo;ll show in a bit)</li>
<li>Dozens of (mostly undocumented in the Changelog) bugfixes</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for more details.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the new <strong>Commander</strong> in action:</p>

<p><img src="http://batsov.com/images/articles/projectile-commander.gif"></p>

<p>Basically it gives you a way to invoke many of the Projectile commands
with a single key &ndash; <code>f</code> for <code>find-file</code>, <code>s</code> for <code>switch-project</code>,
etc. It&rsquo;s very handy when switching projects since with this command
you can always pick a different command to execute in the new
project. By the way, <code>projectile-switch-project</code> will now run the
commander, when invoked with a prefix argument (<code>C-u C-c p s</code>).</p>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2013/04/24/wikemacs-lives-on-under-new-stewardship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Several months passed since I stated my intent
<a href="articles/2013/01/27/the-wikemacs-experiment-is-over-long-live-emacswiki/">to shutdown WikEmacs</a>. While
I still consider the project a failed experiment and stand by
everything I wrote in that post, I have received since lots of messages from
people who were sad to see WikEmacs go. One person in particular,
<a href="https://twitter.com/holocronweaver">Jesse Johnson</a>, was committed to
seeing the project move forward and offered to take over its stewardship.</p>

<p>In the end I&rsquo;ve decided that in spirit of the FOSS ideals I don&rsquo;t have
the right to take away something people like and want to use(especially
given the fact that they contributed most of the content there) and
handed over the domain and the data to Jesse.</p>

<p><a href="http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Main_Page">WikEmacs</a> has been running
for a couple of weeks now under his management and will continue to
exist for a long time. If you liked the project I guess this is a good
moment to show you love and spread the word.</p>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2013/01/27/the-wikemacs-experiment-is-over-long-live-emacswiki</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Less than an year ago
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/03/20/die-emacswiki/">amid a lot of turmoil</a>
I&rsquo;ve started
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/03/26/wikemacs-the-other-emacs-wiki/">an alternative to EmacsWiki</a>. The
project took off to a great start, but quickly lost traction and now
it&rsquo;s time to face the truth &ndash; I had an assumption, it turned out it(I)
was wrong and I should come to terms with that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more than apparent at this point that the majority of the Emacs
community is happy with EmacsWiki and that&rsquo;s fine by me. I&rsquo;ll be
closing down WikEmacs after 2-3 months and I suggest that everyone who&rsquo;s
contributed significant chunks of content to it migrate them to
EmacsWiki (I&rsquo;ll personally move everything good I find). I don&rsquo;t want
the work people have done to just disappear.</p>

<p>Given the small interest in WikEmacs I doubt that many will miss it. I
thank all the contributors and the supporters of the idea. In the long
term it would be better for us to have a single repository of Emacs
knowledge, that&rsquo;s why I decided to terminate WikEmacs sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>I want to extend a big public apology to Alex Schroeder for my harsh
criticism of EmacsWiki.  One year later I see that stewarding
documentation projects and nurturing a healthy community around them
is much harder than writing software. I&rsquo;m but a humble software
engineer and you&rsquo;ll have to forgive me for my misguided actions.</p>

<p>I hope that something good has(will) come up from all this drama. At
the very least I urge everyone who cares for EmacsWiki to try and
clean up, extend and improve at least a couple of articles on subjects
that are of importance to him. I know that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll be doing
from now on.</p>

<p>See you on EmacsWiki!</p>

<p>WikEmacs is dead! Long live the one true EmacsWiki!</p>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2012/12/16/emacs-tip-number-8-manipulating-word-case</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One operation that we have to do fairly often when editing text is
manipulating the case of words. The most popular case manipulations
are probably <strong>capitalize</strong>, <strong>convert to lowercase</strong> and <strong>convert to
uppercase</strong>. Emacs naturally has built-in commands for all of those.</p>

<p>Pressing <code>M-c</code> runs the command <code>capitalize-word</code>, which will
capitalize the next word and move the cursor after it. Pressing <code>M--
M-c</code> will capitalize the previous word without moving the cursor.</p>

<p>Pressing <code>M-l</code> runs the command <code>downcase-word</code>, which will lowercase
the next word and move the cursor after it. Pressing <code>M-- M-l</code> will
lowercase the previous word without moving the cursor.</p>

<p>Pressing <code>M-u</code> runs the command <code>upcase-word</code>, which will uppercase the
next word and move the cursor after it. Pressing <code>M-- M-u</code> will uppercase
the previous word without moving the cursor.</p>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2012/12/09/emacs-24-dot-3-introduces-native-osx-full-screen-support</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most requested Emacs features &ndash; native OSX Lion style
full-screen support has finally landed in Emacs 24.3 (due to be
released in a few months). If you&rsquo;re eager to try it out right now
homebrew is a good option:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install emacs --cocoa --use-git-head --HEAD
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Homebrew&rsquo;s devs have even backported the full-screen patch to Emacs
24.2, so if you&rsquo;re not very adventurous you can just do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install emacs --cocoa
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Alternatively you can install the
<a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-pretest-24.2.91-universal-10.6.8.dmg">Emacs 24.2.91 pretest</a>
(or a newer pretest/nightly build) from
<a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">Emacs for Mac OSX</a>. Personally I
recommend this option, since cloning the Emacs git mirror (as homebrew
does) takes like forever.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the beast in action:</p>

    <link href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/12/06/emacs-tip-number-7-remap-return-to-control-in-osx/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-06T16:06:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2012/12/06/emacs-tip-number-7-remap-return-to-control-in-osx</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the major problems when using
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/10/14/emacs-on-osx/">Emacs on OSX</a> is
not related to OSX itself &ndash; the problem has to do with the Mac&rsquo;s
hardware. Recent Mac keyboards(both laptop and desktop, with the
exception of the wired full size Mac keyboard) lack a right <code>Control</code>
key and it happens to be extremely important if you&rsquo;re looking to
fully leverage the power of Emacs.</p>

<p>The traditional solution to the problem is to use a tool like
<a href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/">KeyRemap4MacBook</a> to remap
the right <code>Option</code> key to right <code>Control</code> and to use a snippet like
this to make <code>Command</code> behave like <code>Meta</code> in Emacs:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">mac-command-modifier</span> <span class="ss">&#39;meta</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This works, but it&rsquo;s hardly ideal since you&rsquo;re remapping <code>Option</code> at
fairly low level and you won&rsquo;t be able to use it anywhere as <code>Option</code>.</p>

<p>A much better idea would be to leverage a little know capability of
KeyRemap4MacBook (a great program which despite its name works with
desktop Macs as well) and map the <code>Return</code> key to <code>Control</code> only
when it&rsquo;s held down (it will behave like a normal Return key in all
other situations). The option you&rsquo;ll have to find in KeyRemap4MacBook
is in the <code>Change Return</code> section and it labeled <code>Return to Control_R
(+ When you type Return only, send Return)</code>.</p>

<p>This approach has several advantages.  First and foremost you&rsquo;re not
sacrificing a valuable key like <code>Option</code>. Second &ndash; it&rsquo;s much easier to
hit <code>Return</code> with your right pinky than it is to hit <code>Option</code>
(especially if you&rsquo;re using a US layout keyboard &ndash; these have long
single row <code>Return</code> keys, compared to the short 2 row Returns found on
European keyboards). Lastly, if you&rsquo;ve already remapped <code>CapsLock</code> to
<code>Control</code> (like so many people do) you&rsquo;re getting a pretty symmetrical
mapping on the opposite side of your keyboard.</p>

<p>All in all &ndash; remapping <code>Return</code> to <code>Control</code> is a huge win if you&rsquo;re
using heavily one of Apple&rsquo;s smaller keyboards. Of course, if you have
the option to use an external keyboard you&rsquo;d do yourself a solid if you
obtained a good full size keyboard like the
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2008/06/16/das-keyboard/">Das Keyboard</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-09T21:17:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2012/09/09/guru-mode</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Getting started with Emacs is hard. That&rsquo;s a fact of life and you
shouldn&rsquo;t believe anyone telling you otherwise.</p>

<p>One of the harder parts of the journey to Emacs mastery is remembering
all those keybindings at the beginning (<code>C-h t</code>), which can be really
overwhelming. To make matters worse for many common commands there are
two sets of keybindings &ndash; the Emacs ones (that are touch typing
friendly) and the popular ones (that typically involve the use of the
arrow keys). Most people never get to use the <em>proper</em> keybindings and
forever make use of the arrow keys.</p>

<p>To help Emacs newcomers get used to the proper Emacs keybindings I&rsquo;ve
created <a href="http://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode">guru-mode</a> &ndash; a simple
minor mode that will show you a (helpful) message in the minibuffer
every time you try to use a <em>non Emacs way</em> keybinding.</p>

<p><img src="http://batsov.com/images/articles/guru-mode.png"></p>

<p>It will probably annoy you <strong>a lot</strong> in the beginning, but trust me &ndash;
it&rsquo;ll be worth it in the long run.</p>

<p><code>guru-mode</code> comes bundled with
<a href="http://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> and is available
for installation from <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org">Marmalade</a> and <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net">MELPA</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. True Emacs mastery cannot be achieved if you do not practice
touch typing; if you&rsquo;re doing hunt-and-peck typing you&rsquo;d better fire up the
venerable <code>gtypist</code> before looking at <code>guru-mode</code>.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-09T20:16:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2012/09/09/emacs-support-for-the-slim-template-language</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m mostly a Ruby on Rails developer these days and as such I&rsquo;m pretty
fond of the <a href="http://slim-lang.com">Slim template language</a>. I&rsquo;ve
always hated HTML + ERB, since that evil duo encourages all sorts of
ever practices and recently I&rsquo;ve adopted Slim as a replacement for
my long time favourite ERB alternative &ndash; <a href="http://haml-lang.com">Haml</a>.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t discuss here the shortcomings of Haml vs Slim, but I&rsquo;ll share
with you the big advantage Haml has over Slim (for Emacs users at
least) &ndash; it has a pretty nice major editing mode for Emacs. Slim&rsquo;s
Emacs support on the other hand is rather iffy and is presently mostly
based on <code>haml-mode</code>. That will hopefully change soon, since recently
I&rsquo;ve become a co-maintainer of
<a href="http://github.com/minad/emacs-slim">slim-mode</a> and I plan to improve
it as much as I can (currently I&rsquo;m mostly working on precise
font-locking). Any help from interested parties is, naturally, most
welcome. I very much doubt that me and
<a href="https://github.com/minad">Daniel Mendler</a> are the only two people
dreaming of great Slim experience in Emacs. :&ndash;)</p>

    <link href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/04/06/melpa-homebrew-emacs-edition/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-06T18:04:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2012/04/06/melpa-homebrew-emacs-edition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I wrote an
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/package-management-in-emacs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">article about the state of package management in Emacs</a>. In
that article I pointed out that on the side of <a href="http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el">package.el</a> too much
was riding on the poorly maintained Marmalade repo. Today
Marmalade went dark (again) and many people are wondering what to do
now. The answer is simple &ndash; start using <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/">MELPA</a> instead.</p>

<p>I was thinking of starting a project similar to Marmalade to alleviate
its problems, but then the MELPA project was brought to my
attention. This project follows the Homebrew (unofficial OSX package
manager) model of using simple GitHub collaboration to maintain and
grow a bunch of build recipes. In the case of MELPA, those recipes
show how to bundle upstream source packages into package.el-compliant
packages. The recipes can be tested locally by package authors, and
they are run hourly on the MELPA server to create an HTTP package
archive that Emacs users can simply add to their <code>'package-archives</code>
list. As <a href="http://technomancy.us">Phil Hagelberg</a> said &ndash; there&rsquo;s no reason to drag in
complicated dependencies like Node for something that&rsquo;s essentially a
pile of static files. MELPA on the other hand is written mostly in
Emacs Lisp and is thus much more comprehensible to casual Emacs hackers.</p>

<p>Most packages currently contained in MELPA are development snapshots,
but the project maintainer
<a href="https://github.com/milkypostman">Donald Curtis</a> and
<a href="http://www.sanityinc.com/">Steve Purcell</a> (aka <code>sanityinc</code>) are
working on extending the MELPA build scripts to support stable
packages, using upstream version tags.</p>

<p>Adding a new package to MELPA is as simple as adding a few lines of
code to the <code>pkglist</code> file in MELPA&rsquo;s source code repo:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">name</span> <span class="ss">:url</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;repo url&gt;&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="ss">:fetcher</span> <span class="nv">[git|svn|darcs</span><span class="err">|</span><span class="nv">wiki]</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="nv">[:files</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;&lt;file1&gt;&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You simply have to fork the <a href="https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa">official repo</a>, modify <code>pkglist</code>, send a pull
request and <code>package.el</code> compatible packages will be built
automatically for you on MELPA&rsquo;s server (you can also build the
packages locally to test if everything is OK with your recipes). Sure it&rsquo;s not as easy as
submitting a package via a web UI, but it&rsquo;s a much more robust
approach. It also eliminates a common problem in Marmalade &ndash; there
only the original uploader (+ people selected by him) can update a
package. Often the original uploaders are very hard to find&hellip;</p>

<p>To use MELPA with Emacs 24 (or a recent version of <code>package.el</code>) just
add this to your <code>.emacs</code> (or equivalent):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more info regarding MELPA on its official website and
I&rsquo;d rather not duplicate it here.</p>

<p>I would encourage package authors and users to investigate and
contribute to MELPA. I&rsquo;ve already submitted a bunch of packages
there and rebased <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> to
use MELPA instead of Marmalade.</p>

<p>Together we can turn MELPA into the most extensive and robust community-supported
<code>package.el</code> repo! Emacs users deserve one of those :&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;d like to apologize to everyone insulted by my previous
posts. Contrary to popular belief I acknowledge EmacsWiki&rsquo;s
contribution to the Emacs community. Obviously many people are too
fond of its current format so I doubt that it will ever change
(considerably). I didn&rsquo;t mean to insult anyone, I just wanted to catch
your attention (which unfortunately requires harsher words from time to
time) and point it in the direction of the existing problems.</p>

<p>For the people that weren&rsquo;t happy with EmacsWiki &ndash; the ones that felt
my pain and were looking for a change I present
<a href="http://wikemacs.org">WikEmacs</a> (pronounced wikimacs). It&rsquo;s a
MediaWiki powered Emacs wiki, that will try to bring to the community
cleaner, leaner and more up-to-date documentation.</p>

<p>There are only a few guidelines for the contributors there:</p>

<ul>
<li>articles should be geared only towards the current and future
versions of Emacs (currently 23 and 24) for maintainability&rsquo;s sake.</li>
<li>articles should not copy Emacs&rsquo;s or extension&rsquo;s official
documentation &ndash; they should refer to it instead. An overview, some
nice pointers, tips and links &ndash; that seems like a good article,
doesn&rsquo;t it?</li>
<li>comments and questions should go to an article&rsquo;s discussion page</li>
</ul>


<p>File uploads are disabled on WikEmacs (but image file uploads will
probably be allowed soon) &ndash; it will never host Emacs extensions of any
sort.</p>

<p>There is a Google discussion group
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/wikemacs">here</a>
for more general questions regarding the wiki.</p>

<p>Our goal is not to copy over the 8500 articles available at
EmacsWiki. It&rsquo;s to provide a good road map for new users coming to
Emacs and enough helpful hints and tips for experienced users. Everyone
is welcome to join our efforts.</p>

<p>As far as short term goals go &ndash; have a look at the outlined structure
of the wiki (on its home page), pick a section that interests you and
create/extend/improve it. Our content is licensed with GNU&rsquo;s Free
Documentation License (which is compatible with Wikipedia&rsquo;s and
probably EmacsWiki&rsquo;s GPL2). Some nice blog articles about Emacs might
be converted to wiki articles with permission from their authors. You
might find <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try">pandoc</a> useful to
automatically convert articles from other formats to MediaWiki markup
and <a href="https://launchpad.net/mediawiki-el">mediawiki.el</a> to edit
articles on wiki from the comfort of your beloved editor.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people that brought us the original EmacsWiki. Thanks to
everyone who supported the idea for the new wiki. Thanks in advance to
all future contributors.</p>

<p>Some people will undoubtedly see the birth of WikEmacs as a separatist move to fraction
the Emacs community. To them I&rsquo;d like to say that few things in life
are as productive as competition. Obviously a lot of people willing to
contribute to a new wiki are unwilling to do so for EmacsWiki and vice
versa. This is not a contest and there will be no winner. I wish the
best of luck to EmacsWiki and its supporters. What I wish for is to give
our community the best source of documentation available and the
option to choose.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Yesterday I wrote a highly
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/03/20/die-emacswiki/">controversial article about the state of the EmacsWiki</a>
and suggested a few things we can do to make things better. I got the
usual batch of hate mail and some remarks on the poor quality of my
English and writing style (which generally amuse me a lot). But I
got much more encouraging feedback from <strong>a lot</strong> of Emacs community
members. So here our story continues&hellip;</p>

<!--more -->


<h2>On The Essence of Things</h2>

<p>Some people accused me that I don&rsquo;t even know what I wiki is. To them
I&rsquo;d like to say that a thing is not its dictionary/encyclopedia
definition. A thing is what it&rsquo;s perceived to be. People expect wiki
entries to look and behave like those found in MediaWiki or Confluence
and not like some mixture of a wiki, forum and irc conversation&hellip;</p>

<h2>A Word from Our Sponsor</h2>

<p>Alex wrote a
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2012-03-20">public response on the EmacsWiki</a>
yesterday, that I&rsquo;d first like to share (since probably more people
will see it here, than there). I publish it here with no alternations:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bozhidar Batsov is apparently very frustrated with Emacs Wiki. He<br/>seems to think that we should start over – use new software, add<br/>moderators, guidelines, and sorts of fancy stuff. My answer is the<br/>same as it was back in 2008 (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MissionRant).</p><p>One of his ideas I actually agree with. &#8220;Submit documentation only to<br/>the official project pages.&#8221; Absolutely. :)</p><p>Some ideas I am luke warm about: &#8220;package something on Marmalade…&#8221;<br/>Sure, why not? I have never used Marmalade, but I encourage you to<br/>improve the tools you use. There&#8217;s also &#8220;don&#8217;t respond to any bug<br/>requests regarding modified copies of your sources distributed via<br/>EmacsWiki.&#8221; I also don&#8217;t want to encourage bug reports on the<br/>wiki. Use the facilities built into Emacs to report bugs. But almost<br/>all of you know that.</p><p>But other ideas?</p><p>&#8220;Drop the current format of the wiki - use something standard like<br/>MediaWiki instead of OddMuse.&#8221; How is reformatting the pages going to<br/>improve them?</p><p>&#8220;Drop all the articles about Emacs extensions.&#8221; Just delete them? Are<br/>you at least going to rewrite them and move them to the appropriate<br/>project pages out there? Or are you just going to delete them? Taking<br/>away and not giving back?</p><p>&#8220;Drop all the extensions hosted there.&#8221; Some of the old code has no<br/>other home. Some of the old code is here for the poor sods stuck with<br/>Emacs 20. Are you going to package them for ELPA or Marmalade or<br/>whatever you are going to suggest instead?</p><p>Some of you – like Drew Adams – keep their packages on the wiki. For<br/>those packages, I don&#8217;t see any alternative. Are you going to maintain<br/>his software? Fix his bugs? Develop his features? Unless you are, I<br/>guess you can try and fork his stuff and keep it on whatever other<br/>system you want. But please don&#8217;t suggest taking something away<br/>without giving something in return.</p><p>&#8220;Assemble a team of moderators.&#8221; Indeed. Moderators! Where have you<br/>been hiding for the last ten years! Are you volunteering? I&#8217;m a bit<br/>wary regarding your deletionist tendencies. But perhaps you’d like to<br/>start with a new Table of Contents and new top-down menus where only<br/>the pages you personally vetted and checked are listed. That would be<br/>an awesome thing to do! Of course, there’s no need to delete anything<br/>in order for you to do this. Just arrange the stuff you like and do<br/>it.</p><p>In fact, in order to do it, just do it.</p><p>&#8220;Accept only articles about general Emacs usage and Emacs Lisp<br/>programming.&#8221; How is that going to work – more deleting? I don&#8217;t<br/>know&#8230; I don&#8217;t think you understand where the value of Emacs Wiki<br/>comes from. Perhaps you should write a book about Emacs? Collect a<br/>team of authors and editors and deletionists, take a copy of the wiki,<br/>and just do it right.</p><p>Also, less hyperbole when posting&#8230; :P</p><footer><strong>Alex Schroeder</strong> <cite>Creator and Maintainer of EmacsWiki.org</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Here&rsquo;s my two cents on the letter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The markup format hardly matters. A new wiki engine would give us
better structure of the wiki as whole (like separate discussion pages
for one).</p></li>
<li><p>Dropping it from the wiki doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll delete the code
forever. What I meant was &ndash; dump all the extensions to some archive
for the interested parties and remove them from the wiki. You&rsquo;re
basically putting words in my mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>We should care for the bad choices some people made (like Drew &ndash; all
my respect to his work). With so many free project hosting services I
don&rsquo;t feel we&rsquo;ll be taking something away and not giving an alternative.</p></li>
<li><p>No, I don&rsquo;t volunteer. Not for this format of the wiki. But I do
volunteer for an alternative matching the outline I&rsquo;ve suggested.</p></li>
<li><p>Mocking me is not right response, you know. The problem exists, you
fail to acknowledge it, but I don&rsquo;t care that much.</p></li>
<li><p>Alex calls it hyperbole, I call it the simple truth (and many others
would second me).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>Many people commented that my post is not worth a damn if I&rsquo;m not
willing to back it with action. I&rsquo;m sad to disappoint my critics &ndash; but
I&rsquo;ll willing to go the whole nine yards on this one. Here&rsquo;s the
outline of my proposal for a new wiki:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://moinmo.in/">MoinMoin</a> as the wiki engine. It&rsquo;s written in Python and
it&rsquo;s GPL software. It doesn&rsquo;t use a database, it&rsquo;s featureful and
mature. It&rsquo;s successfully used by Debian and Ubuntu (and many other
respectable software organizations). I&rsquo;m against using a Git backed
systems since it will increase the entry bar for user
participation. I&rsquo;m even more against the use of a custom platform
developed specially to serve as the EmacsWiki.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ll pay for the hosting and the new domain and set up the wiki
initially. I&rsquo;d suggest that the new project begins with the domain
emacswiki.net or emacswiki.info and eventually we&rsquo;ll assume the old
emacswiki.org domain as well (should the new wiki be successful
enough). Suggestions for another name are welcome in the comments
section.</p></li>
<li><p>I and anyone willing to lend a hand will pick the articles worth
saving from the EmacsWiki and migrate them to the new one. I and
anyone willing to serve as moderator will monitor new contributions
afterwards.</p></li>
<li><p>Wiki entries will have a more or less standard structure and will
adhere and community established guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>The old EmacsWiki will eventually be retired to another domain such
as old.emacswiki.org (or similar) for historic purposes and benefit of
users of old Emacs versions.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It this good enough for you to call it an action plan? Comments on it
are most welcome!</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that I&rsquo;m the guy that has to break the terrible news to all of
the delusional EmacsWiki supporters out there &ndash; <em>It&rsquo;s not
special. It&rsquo;s not a beautiful or unique snowflake. It&rsquo;s the same
decaying wiki matter like some many else.</em> I&rsquo;m sorry for my terrible
English and my lack of good manners. I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m willing do to
something while so many of you are just whining and ignoring the
existing problems.</p>

<p>I think as a member of the Emacs community I&rsquo;ve shown my worth so far
and I&rsquo;ll willing to do even more. But I cannot carry out such a
massive undertaking on my own. I encourage everyone serious about
helping out to comment the article (here, not on reddit or hacker
news) or send me a personal email.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>The new wiki is now available at
<a href="http://wikemacs.org">http://wikemacs.org</a>. It&rsquo;s using MediaWiki (it
turned out it had several nice advantages over MoinMoin).</p>

    <updated>2012-03-20T14:49:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2012/03/20/die-emacswiki</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Emacs is slowly, but firmly moving in the right direction with
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2011/08/19/a-peek-at-emacs24/">Emacs 24</a>. A
lot of new important features are coming, the release date is nearing,
but there is something worrisome on the otherwise bright Emacs
horizon. It&rsquo;s a remnant from the <strong>Dark Emacs Days</strong> and it&rsquo;s called
<a href="http://emacswiki.org">EmacsWiki</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly put &ndash; <em>EmacsWiki is a blight</em>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>A Little Bit of Background</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the longer story. EmacsWiki was created by
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/">Alex Schroeder</a> (aka <strong>kensanata</strong>)
way back (in 2001) with the goal to become the home of all the Emacs
information one would ever need (both about Emacs in general and its
extensions). I have to admit that this was a noble goal and I know that
Alex had all the right intentions, but unfortunately right intentions
rarely are enough for things to always move in the right
direction.</p>

<p>The software behind the wiki is called
<a href="http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse">OddMuse</a> and it&rsquo;s authored by
Alex himself. It&rsquo;s pretty basic Perl script and doesn&rsquo;t feature db
support. Its motto is <em>No MySQL; no PostgreSQL; no worries.</em> &ndash; wish it
were true&hellip;</p>

<h2>The Problems</h2>

<p>The EmacsWiki has several epic problems. Here we go:</p>

<h3>Odd Choice for a Wiki</h3>

<p>Even if in the beginning OddMuse might have been a good choice (Alex
authored it and MediaWiki didn&rsquo;t exist back then), it hasn&rsquo;t been a
good choice for quite a while. There are much better solutions in
terms of markup support (Markdown anyone?), usability and
performance. Some of the features of the wiki are simply abhorring &ndash;
like the lack of user access control; anyone can enter any user name and
edit the wiki&hellip; Yep, this is not a joke&hellip;</p>

<h3>Moderators, Where Art Though?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen so much junk in a wiki in my entire life (and I&rsquo;ve
seen the wikis of 15-year enterprise systems). When I was
an Emacs beginner I often consulted the wiki for advice &ndash; even then I
noticed that there were some suspicious practices being suggested
there. Now I can say with certainly that much of the content there is
total bullshit &ndash; it&rsquo;s mostly written by people with very little
knowledge of Emacs (not to mention good Emacs practices). The articles
are littered with crappy advice confusing beginners, have little
structure and are filled with ridiculous questions (questions in an
wiki???). All of this would have been avoided had the EmacsWiki had a
team of moderators to keep shitty contributions at bay. Alas, such a
team does not exist (or does a very crappy job of it).</p>

<h3>Software Distribution Medium</h3>

<p>As crazy as it seems a lot of people are using the wiki as a software
distribution mechanism. Instead of hosting their projects in version
control (say <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>) they develop stuff locally,
upload them to the wiki and say that this is the canonical way to
obtain their software. Needless to say &ndash; this is a horrible, horrible
practice. I&rsquo;ve often encountered on the wiki source files authored by
someone, then edited by 10 different guys, that have a tendency to add
their names to the copyrights sections instead of thinking how their
poor users will understand what exactly was changed in these
files. Sometimes the authors themselves are to blame (for being
fucking lazy), but often someone just copies a snapshot of a project
from version control and uploads it to the wiki, creating problems of
epic proportions for the maintainers, who start receiving bugs about
stuff they never developed in the first place.</p>

<p>For the love of God &ndash; take your project(s) to GitHub and develop them
there with pleasure, under the scrutiny of an active and passionate
developer community. Wikis should be used for documentation only!</p>

<p>Tools like audo-install (an extension that supports installing
software from EmacsWiki) should never have existed. el-get should not
have added support for the installation of stuff from the wiki. As
long as such practices are tolerated they will not stop.</p>

<p>Need I remind you that we&rsquo;re now living in the era of
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/package-management-in-emacs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">package.el</a>
and distributed version control (Git, Mercurial, Bazaar)? Act accordingly!</p>

<h3>Jack of All Trades</h3>

<p>Documenting each and every Emacs project is an impossible task. And it
should not be centralized. Each project should be responsible for
producing its own up-to-date easy-to-follow crystal-clear
documentation. By putting everything in one place you&rsquo;re just making
sure you&rsquo;ll end up with a pile of out-of-date confusing unstructured
ramblings (the EmacsWiki proves my point).</p>

<p>An EmacsWiki shouldn&rsquo;t list tips on the use of external projects &ndash;
such tips should be in the project&rsquo;s wiki. An EmacsWiki should
document the core Emacs experience and customizations only.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Kill the EmacsWiki! (may it be reborn from its ashes)</p>

<h3>Action Plan for The Maintainers</h3>

<p>Drop the current format of the wiki &ndash; use something standard like
MediaWiki instead of OddMuse. Drop all the articles about Emacs
extensions. Drop all the extensions hosted there. Assemble
a team of moderators. Accept only articles about general Emacs usage
and Emacs Lisp programming.</p>

<h3>Action Plan for Emacs Extensions Authors</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a normal project hosted on GitHub (or a similar service)
&ndash; delete everything about your project on the wiki and don&rsquo;t respond
to any bug requests regarding modified copies of your sources
distributed via EmacsWiki.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a project hosted on the EmacsWiki &ndash; there is still
a chance for you to redeem yourself. Migrate your project(s) to GitHub
(you&rsquo;ll thank me later for that). Use their version control, their
issue tracker, their wiki system. Start distributing your project via
Marmalade or MELPA (<code>package.el</code> repos). Your life will become much nicer and
the visibility of your project and the possibility to attract new
developers will be significantly boosted. GitHub is a project hosting
solution, the EmacsWiki is not.</p>

<h3>The Regular Users</h3>

<p>Boycott the wiki (unless the maintainers take actions)! Submit
documentation only to the official project pages. Ignore projects
hosted on the EmacsWiki. (or migrate them to GitHub if they seem
orphaned and try to rekindle them)</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Do we need an EmacsWiki? Certainly we do! But we need a <strong>real</strong>
EmacsWiki and not this abomination that is currently a detriment to
new Emacs users, instead of help. The wiki needs restructuring, but
first it needs to die. I hope you&rsquo;ll see the truth in my words and
take action instead of commenting how outrageous my claims are. Do
something meaningful for a change &ndash; save a project from the EmacsWiki,
contribute documentation to an official project&rsquo;s wiki, package
something on Marmalade&hellip;</p>

<p>Die, Die EmacsWiki! I&rsquo;ll be seeing you in hell&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>This post stirred a huge discussion online and as a result there is
now another Emacs wiki out there. The new wiki is available at
<a href="http://wikemacs.org">http://wikemacs.org</a>. It&rsquo;s using MediaWiki (it
turned out it had several nice advantages over MoinMoin).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I program in Java I usually leave the comfort of Emacs and use
IntelliJ IDEA instead (for various reasons that are irrelevant to this
post). IDEA has one particularly nice feature &ndash; &ldquo;auto-save on focus
lost&rdquo;. Basically you never have to hit <code>C-s</code> there explicitly, because
any time your current editor window loses focus its contents get
flushed to the disk automatically. Implementing something exactly the
same in Emacs is impossible (at least in Emacs Lisp), but we can
create a solution that is similar in spirit at least &ndash; we can
auto-save buffers when we switch the Emacs window or the current
buffer (which are more or less the most popular ways to change editing
focus in Emacs). This is easy to achieve in Emacs Lisp:</p>

<p>Obviously this code could have been written in a more compact manner
with the use of a macro, but I&rsquo;ve decided to use this more verbose
variant for the sake of simplicity. We assume that you want to
auto-save your current work (buffer) when you switch to a new buffer
or to a new window (with either <code>C-x o</code> (<code>other-window</code>) or a
<code>windmove</code> command).</p>

<p>XEmacs has a hook called <code>deselect-frame-hook</code> that can take the
concept even further, but it&rsquo;s absent from GNU Emacs.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s all for this tip, folks! I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed it!
Personally I find it much more useful that the standard auto-save
mechanism in Emacs. And one more thing &ndash;
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> naturally
enables this functionality by default.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some times you&rsquo;d want to quickly repeat an Emacs command several times and
most of the time it won&rsquo;t have a convenient keybinding you can use to
do this. Enter <code>C-x z</code> (<code>repeat</code>) &ndash; it simply repeats the most
recently executed command. And the best part? After you&rsquo;ve pressed
<code>C-x z</code> once you can continue repeating the last command simply by
pressing <code>z</code>. Vi(m) users will probably note that this is quite similar
to the <code>.</code> command there.</p>

<p>For instance &ndash; if you want to execute the <code>er/expand-region</code> command
(part of the

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; although a vanilla Emacs installation is quite
powerful almost nobody is using Emacs without a pile of add-ons. And
managing those add-ons is quite frankly a pain in the ass. Traditional
options included installing Emacs add-ons via the operating system&rsquo;s
package manager (if available), downloading <code>.el</code> files from various
locations (everybody hates packages distributed only on Emacs Wiki
with no canonical version control repo) and simply sticking them on
the <code>load-path</code>, etc. It&rsquo;s more than obvious that such solutions are
less than ideal.</p>

<p>For instance if you&rsquo;re installing Emacs add-ons via a package manager
and you have to change OSes (or machines) you&rsquo;re mostly fucked. On the
other hand piling files manually in <code>.emacs.d</code> is equal to hell in the
version and dependency tracking department. There has to be a better
way, right? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if Emacs had its own package manager
similar to the likes of <code>homebrew</code>, <code>apt</code> or <code>yum</code>?</p>

<p><a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2011/08/19/a-peek-at-emacs24/">Emacs 24</a>
finally introduces such a tool &ndash; its name is <code>package.el</code> (very
original, right?) and it&rsquo;s promise is to make you&rsquo;re lives a bit
easier. Does it manage to deliver on that promise? We&rsquo;ll see that in a bit&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Package management with package.el</h2>

<p><code>package.el</code> is bundled with Emacs 24, but it&rsquo;s not bound to Emacs
24. Before it became part of Emacs it was an external package, known
as ELPA (I guess that stood for Emacs Lisp Package Manager or
something similar). So even if you&rsquo;re an Emacs 23 user you can copy
the latest version of <code>package.el</code> from
<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git/blob_plain/1a0a666f941c99882093d7bd08ced15033bc3f0c:/lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el">here</a>
and enjoy it. At this point you&rsquo;ll have to do something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="ss">&#39;package</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">package-initialize</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Put this snippet of code near the beginning of your Emacs config,
since you&rsquo;ll definitely want packages installed via <code>package.el</code> to be
initalized <em>before</em> you start tweaking them.</p>

<p>What <code>package.el</code> basically does is that it connects to a list of
package repositories, retrieves the list of the packages there,
presents it to you in a interactive fashion and lets you install the
packages you like (of course you can also remove the once you don&rsquo;t
like). <code>package.el</code> understands the dependencies between packages and
if one package requires others to run they will be installed
automatically (which is really neat).</p>

<p>The magic starts with the command <code>M-x package-list-packages</code>. At this
point you should see something in the lines of this.</p>

<p><img src="http://batsov.com/images/articles/packages-list.png"></p>

<p>You can navigate the list of packages, mark the ones you want to
install with the &ldquo;i&rdquo; key or the ones you want removed with the &ldquo;d&rdquo; key
and when you&rsquo;re done you can press the &ldquo;x&rdquo; key to execute the
scheduled actions.</p>

<p>Initially <code>package.el</code> didn&rsquo;t provide the option to update a package,
but that should be fixed in recent Emacs builds. According to this
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2011-09/msg00371.html">thread</a>
you can even update all of the installed packages by using the &ldquo;U&rdquo; key
in the packages list view (I guess that a small &ldquo;u&rdquo; would update only
one package). Unfortunately my build is lacking those capabilities so
I cannot comment of their usability.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d probably notice that your list of available packages is not
particularly long. That&rsquo;s because the official Emacs 24 package
repository has a strict licensing (and source code) requirements to
include a package there. Luckily there are a number of
community-maintained <code>package.el</code> repos around with much more relaxed
requirements. Probably the most popular of them is
<a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade</a>, created by
<a href="http://nex-3.com/">Nathan Weizenbaum</a> of Sass and Haml fame. You can
include it in your <code>package-archives</code> list like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">&#39;package-archives</span>
</span><span class='line'>             <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;marmalade&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Marmalade provides a web based UI for package upload and search (both
quite buggy unfortunately) and the ability to share the maintenance of
a package between several people, who&rsquo;ll be able to upload new version
of the package. There&rsquo;s also a Emacs Lisp Marmalade tool, that allows
you to submit packages directly from Emacs.</p>

<p>Using the <code>package.el</code> UI is ok if you&rsquo;re a casual Emacs user, but
what if you have a custom Emacs configuration, stored under version
control, that you&rsquo;d like to instantly deploy on any OS/machine (like
Emacs Prelude). Here in play comes <code>package.el</code>&rsquo;s programmer
interface. In
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> I use the
following code to install a list of required packages automatically on Emacs
startup (if necessary):</p>

<h2>The Bad and the Ugly</h2>

<p>While <code>package.el</code> is great on paper, for it to really take off some
problems need to be resolved.</p>

<h4>Updating should be easy</h4>

<p>One of the best features of OS package managers is that they make it
really easy to update all of the installed packages to their latest
versions. Currently <code>package.el</code> doesn&rsquo;t support that (at least to my
knowledge), with the exception of the &ldquo;U&rdquo; key in the list packages
view. This seems to me like a pretty basic feature and I (and everyone
I&rsquo;ve talked with) would really like to see it in Emacs 24 final.</p>

<h4>Too much is riding on Marmalade</h4>

<p>Marmalade has become extremely important in the recent months and the
list of packages there is growing every day. This would have normally
filled me with great joy, if it weren&rsquo;t for a few problems.</p>

<p>It seems that the project isn&rsquo;t getting much attention from its maintainer
(which is understandable, given the fact that he&rsquo;s maintaining several
high profile projects + the fact he&rsquo;s a full time Google
employee). As a result Marmalade is quite buggy (especially in the UI
department) and is missing key features, like the ability to contact a
package maintainer. At some point it was even lacking the ability to
delete a package. Uploads don&rsquo;t work reliably there, package refresh
sometimes yields http errors that require manual <code>M-x
package-refresh-contents</code> and from time to time there is even downtime
of the service.</p>

<p>The fact that its backend is written in Node.js (great technology, but
not widely understood for now) and hosted on Google
Code, doesn&rsquo;t improve the situation a lot. A Ruby or Python based
solution hosted on GitHub would certainly gain much more traction in
the community (and I&rsquo;m planning to start work on one soon).</p>

<h4>Scarce documentation</h4>

<p><code>package.el</code> is light on the documentation and you&rsquo;ll have to explore
its source code if you want to implement its required interface
(which luckily is very simple). I hope this will change by the release
of Emacs 24.</p>

<h4>Too few package authors care about package.el</h4>

<p>Package authors rarely tag versions that could be uploaded to a
<code>package.el</code> compatible repo and from time to time don&rsquo;t follow the
basic structure required. I always contact package authors to let them
know of such shortcomings in their packages and so should you.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dimitri/el-get">el-get</a> is another popular Emacs
add-ons management solution that has recently become popular.</p>

<p>el-get allows you to install and manage elisp code for Emacs. It
supports lots of differents types of sources (git, svn, apt, elpa,
etc) and is able to install them, update them and remove them, but
more importantly it will init them for you.</p>

<p>That means it will require the features you need, load the necessary
files, set the Info paths so that <code>C-h i</code> shows the new documentation
you now depend on, and finally call your own <code>:post-init</code> function for
you to setup the extension. Or call it a package.</p>

<p>el-get is inherently troublesome piece of software on Windows machines
and was originally designed to make it simple to obtain the latest
versions of packages from git &ndash; a practice which I profoundly
dislike. Master package branches are often buggy (but there are also
authors that never tag versions and rely on the rolling release model)
and I&rsquo;m generally supportive of the stable version releases. While
some view it as a nice addition to <code>package.el</code> I feel that el-get is
too low level tool (in its approach to the problem) and should be
avoided.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>A few hours after I posted this article it got a nice lengthy comment
by el-get&rsquo;s author. Since I believe, that the comment is quite
interesting I&rsquo;m adding it here without any alterations.</p>

<blockquote><p>As the author of el-get, good article!  The Emacs extension situation<br/>is far from ideal and needs hard critics so that work is done to<br/>improve it.</p><p>I now want to share with you some of the features that are currently<br/>only available in the development branch of el-get (soon to be<br/>released as 4.1): you can now easily checkout a stable branch from a<br/>git repository (thanks to the :checkout property) and you can even<br/>setup which checksum you want installed.So when using git, the<br/>checksum is in fact a revision, when using emacswiki you have to<br/>compute the checksum (doing M-x el-get-checksum) and register it in<br/>your el-get-sources setup, then if the file change on emacswiki el-get<br/>will refuse loading it (hopefully until you&#8217;ve done your review then<br/>updated the checksum).So while I perfectly understand your reserve<br/>toward depending on el-get, I believe that your concerns are being<br/>solved now.I would like to believe that authors of emacs lisp scripts<br/>would take the time to consider formatting their sources for<br/>package.el. Today it&#8217;s far from granted, so by choosing ELPA you miss<br/>a lot of things. And for the situation to change you need to have the<br/>authors willing to package their extensions, or you have to fork their<br/>work. With el-get you have access to 536 packages from the get-go, and<br/>all of emacswiki (that&#8217;s currently more than 1700 packages) after<br/>you&#8217;ve done M-x el-get-emacswiki-refresh. As of writing this comment,<br/>my M-x el-get-package-list contains 2106 packages ready to install,<br/>almost all with descriptions.el-get is about social packaging where<br/>it&#8217;s easy to prepare a recipe for a package, whatever distribution<br/>means its author picked. Then you can share that recipe very easily,<br/>for example with el-get on github where we&#8217;ll be happy to add your<br/>work and have it installed by default when users either install el-get<br/>or do M-x el-get-self-update.As for windows support, it all depends on<br/>the packages you want to install. Most of them just work out of the<br/>box, being a single emacs lisp file (.el). Some of them require to<br/>have extra tools installed, from git or svn or mercurial to make and<br/>autoconf. That&#8217;s only how the authors are shipping their extensions<br/>though, el-get is only providing for an integrated way to get at it.<br/>We have accepted several improvements so that the windows experience<br/>matches the others OS, and we consider windows a first class citizen<br/>here.</p><footer><strong>Dimitri Fontaine</strong> <cite>Author of El-get</cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p><code>package.el</code> is the future of Emacs add-on management &ndash; of that I&rsquo;m
quite certain. It&rsquo;s far from perfect, but even in its present flawed
form it has already simplified the life of many Emacs users
immensely. I urge all of you to stop distributing Emacs packages via
sources such as the Emacs Wiki and to put a heavy emphasis on
<code>package.el</code>. Make your packages compatible with it, upload them to a
community maintained repo (or the official if possible) and keep them
up-to-date. Your users will love you for that!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a replacement to Marmalade in the future as well. A
more robust and polished solution, maintained by a team of several
people. Hopefully that moment is not that far in the future.</p>

<p>If there is something that people love as much as tweaking their
editing configurations it&rsquo;s probably the selection of color themes. A
good color theme can make your work much more pleasant and a bad one
that literally impair your vision. It&rsquo;s a fact of life that I&rsquo;m a firm
supporter of low-contrast color themes with dark backgrounds &ndash; I find
them easy on the eyes and I feel that they don&rsquo;t strain the eyes as
much as most themes. I&rsquo;ve even ported a couple of popular themes to
Emacs &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs">Solarized</a>.</p>

<p>In this short article we&rsquo;ll see how color theming has changed in Emacs
24 and I&rsquo;ll share with you a few tips on theme creation and
distribution.</p>

<h2>Color Theming in Emacs 24</h2>

<p>Prior to Emacs 24 the most popular way to incorporate custom color
themes into Emacs was the
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme">color-theme package</a>. While
it usually got the job done it had some problems that I won&rsquo;t be
discussing here and more importantly &ndash; it&rsquo;s a third-party package,
that&rsquo;s not part of Emacs proper.</p>

<p><a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2011/08/19/a-peek-at-emacs24/">Emacs 24</a>
finally introduced a new standard way of dealing with color themes
(based on Emacs&rsquo;s built-in customize facility). While it doesn&rsquo;t have
a proper name (as far as I know) it&rsquo;s commonly referred to as the
<code>deftheme</code> facility, since <code>deftheme</code> is the name of the macro you&rsquo;d
use to create such a theme. ( <code>deftheme</code> has actually been around
since Emacs 23, but it was heavily improved in Emacs 24 )</p>

<p>Emacs 24 comes with a selection of built-in themes that you can choose
from, so you&rsquo;re no longer bound to the default theme (which I find
quite ugly). To choose a new theme just do a <code>M-x load-theme</code> (tab
completion is available for the names of the available themes). At
this point you can give the command a try with the <code>tango</code> theme. If you
like a theme so much that you&rsquo;d want to use it all the time you can
put in your Emacs configuration (<code>.emacs</code> or <code>init.el</code> for instance) like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">load-theme</span> <span class="ss">&#39;theme-name</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you&rsquo;d like to return to the default-theme just do a <code>M-x disable-theme</code>.</p>

<p>How do you create a <code>deftheme</code> theme? Quite simply actually &ndash; just do
a &ldquo;M-x customize-create-theme&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll be presented with an UI
prompting you for a theme name, description and faces. After you save
the theme a file called <code>name-theme.el</code> will be written on your
filesystem. Here&rsquo;s its skeleton:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">deftheme</span> <span class="nv">demo</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s">&quot;Demo theme&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">custom-theme-set-faces</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="ss">&#39;demo</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="c1">;;; list of custom faces</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">provide-theme</span> <span class="ss">&#39;demo</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There was also an online theme generator
<a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/themes/">here</a>, but it seems to be down at the
moment.</p>

<p>Personally I dislike customize a lot, so when I needed to create a
Emacs 24 theme for the first time I&rsquo;ve just opened the source code of
the built-in tango theme and used it as a reference.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created the new theme you&rsquo;ll have to drop it in a folder
that&rsquo;s on the <code>custom-theme-load-path</code>. I&rsquo;d suggest the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">&#39;custom-theme-load-path</span> <span class="s">&quot;~/.emacs.d/themes&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you&rsquo;re an <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a>
user you&rsquo;re already covered. This folder exists and is automatically
added to <code>custom-theme-load-path</code> by Prelude, so all you have to do is
drop there the themes you&rsquo;d want to try out.</p>

<p>You may find the
<a href="http://julien.danjou.info/software/rainbow-mode">rainbow-mode</a> useful
when developing color themes. If fontifies strings that represent
color codes according to those colors. The mode is known to be a great
addition to css-mode, but I find it very helpful with color theme
development as well. It&rsquo;s also included (and enabled) in Prelude by
default. Here you can see it in action.</p>

<p>The Emacs package manager <code>package.el</code> (formerly known as ELPA) is
gaining a lot of popularity lately and the community
<a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade</a> repository already houses a few
Emacs 24 themes that you can install from there. If you&rsquo;re developing
a theme that you&rsquo;d like to submit to Marmalade it&rsquo;s imperative that
the theme modifies the <code>custom-theme-load-path</code> in an <code>autoload</code> &ndash;
otherwise it won&rsquo;t be of much use. Add the following snippet (or
something similar) before the <code>provide-theme</code> line if your custom
theme:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;;###autoload</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="nv">load-file-name</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">&#39;custom-theme-load-path</span>
</span><span class='line'>               <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file-name-as-directory</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file-name-directory</span> <span class="nv">load-file-name</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&rsquo;d also advise you follow the proper naming convention
<code>name-theme.el</code> so that it&rsquo;s apparent that your theme is <code>deftheme</code>
compatible.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing &ndash; porting themes from color-theme to deftheme is
really simple (just have a look at the old and the new version of
Zenburn in its repo), so you should really consider porting all the
themes you maintain to <code>deftheme</code>.</p>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>Color theming in Emacs has never been easier. It&rsquo;s time to kill
<code>color-theme</code> once and for all. If you&rsquo;ve ever developed a color theme
for it I urge you to convert it to the <code>deftheme</code> format and upload it
to Marmalade.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;ve never developed a color theme for Emacs because you were
afraid it was too hard &ndash; now is the time to do it.</p>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2011/12/03/solarized-for-emacs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve created a new port of the
<a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized color theme</a> for
Emacs 24. While there is
<a href="https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized">another existing port of the theme</a>
I&rsquo;ve decided to into a separate direction since I&rsquo;ve wanted to keep
the development of Solarized and
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn</a> for Emacs in sync.</p>

<p>So without further ado here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the theme (or the dark
variant to be precise):</p>

<p><img src="http://batsov.com/images/articles/solarized-emacs.png"></p>

<p>Note that this is a very early version and I haven&rsquo;t fine tuned all
the colors yet. The source code and installation instructions can be
found on <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The theme is already bundled in
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> and I&rsquo;ll
submit it to Marmalade soon. Note that I&rsquo;ve dropped some things like
the degraded palette and the 16 color palette (at least for now),
since I doubt many people need them. On the other hand &ndash; you&rsquo;ll proper
coloring in most prominent modes out of the box.</p>

<p>Feedback, suggestions and patches are always welcome.</p>
